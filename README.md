Overview:

The Jupyter notebook named Practical_Application_1 can be used to gain insight about
acceptance rate of a food coupon when it is oﬀered to a driver of a vehicle in use.

Data:

This data is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and was collected via a survey on
Amazon Mechanical Turk.

Findings Summary:

Roughly 56.9% of coupon oEerings were accepted, but depending on the type of coupon,
the acceptance rates were widely diEerent with Carry out & Take away being the most
popular and Bar coupon being the least.
The granularity on temperate information in the dataset was inadequate but generally a
colder temperature had a higher rate of acceptance.
Acceptance rate of bar coupons was over 70% if a driver went to a bar at least once a week.
The acceptance rate was not a strong function of age, occupation or marital status. The data
indicated that having a minor passenger could be a strong factor in accepting a bar coupon.
Financial status of a driver (cost of going to restaurants and income) was another strong
factor in determining the acceptance rate.
Acceptance rate for Carry Out and Take away ( CoTa) coupon was 73.8%, which was
significantly higher than bar coupon acceptance rate. The history of using CoTa had a small
influence on accepting a coupon of that type (less then 3% improvement). Similarly, factors
such as age, marital status, age, passenger type and occupation had a weak impact on
acceptance rate of Cota coupon acceptance. Interestingly, even financial status of a driver
had a small impact on acceptance rate with people with income less than $50K only had 3%
higher acceptance rate compared to all others.
